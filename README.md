# Python Projects

Hello!  
This repository contains Python projects I’ve built while learning and practicing Python — from beginner fundamentals to intermediate, object-oriented programs.

The goal of this repo is to:
- Strengthen Python fundamentals
- Practice problem-solving and logic
- Build small but complete programs from scratch
- Progress from procedural code to clean OOP design

# PROJ 24 – Generative Geometry (Turtle Graphics)

A Python Turtle project that dynamically generates and overlays multiple regular polygons with randomized RGB colors.

This project demonstrates mathematical angle calculation, nested loops, and basic generative art techniques.

## What It Does

- Draws polygons from 3 sides (triangle) to 10 sides (decagon)
- Automatically calculates turning angle using:

  angle = 360 / number_of_sides

- Applies a random RGB color to each shape
- Overlays all polygons from the same starting position
- Animates the drawing process using Turtle speed control

## Concepts Demonstrated

- Nested loops
- Mathematical geometry (360° rule)
- RGB color generation
- Randomization
- Turtle graphics
- Programmatic shape generation

## Core Logic

Outer loop:
- Controls number of sides (3–10)

Inner loop:
- Draws one complete polygon

This repository documents my progression from beginner Python fundamentals to intermediate object-oriented programming and structured, multi-file project design.
